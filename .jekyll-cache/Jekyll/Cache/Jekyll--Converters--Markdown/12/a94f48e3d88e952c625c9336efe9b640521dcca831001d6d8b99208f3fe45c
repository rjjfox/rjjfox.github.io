I"b<p>A T-shaped person is someone who is capable in many things and an expert in at least one. This is a phrase I learnt about recently and I like to think it justifies the meandering way that I go around in my passion to learn.</p>

<p>I am regularly falling down the rabbit hole on random topics such as django, jekyll, JIRA query language, Powershell use and more. These are skills that I will sometimes learn for a few days or a week and then use infrequently or not at all.</p>

<p>I’m able to do this currently whilst I am away from deadlines and work pressures. I pursue anything that I enjoy and I enjoy the the process of learning as much as anything. I’m not becoming a master in many of the things I’m doing. I am learning for the explicit purpose of applying it to solve a problem or complete a task I have and then putting it aside when it’s no longer needed.</p>

<p>Discovering the phrase a ‘T-shaped person’ makes me feel much better about this shallow knowledge grab that’s going on as one day this may allow me to help out an expert dealing with a bottleneck. I may be able to help with my knowledge take some of his/her area to help the team deal with it’s workload.</p>

<p>The need for ‘I-shaped’ people is rarer today than in the past, especially in the tech/web industry. You don’t only want an expert in data analysis methods, you want an expert in data analysis with some business strategy, communication skills, ML knowledge and data vis.</p>
