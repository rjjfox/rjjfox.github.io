<p>Iâ€™ve recently started working through this book in a course on Udemy run by the author himself, for free.</p>

<p>Al Sweigart appears to be making every effort to making his book available to everyone, by making it avaiable online for free, and also by offering vouchers for free access to his Udemy course in which he runs through each chapter in his highly praised book.</p>

<p>Al Sweigart appears to be making every effort to making his book available to everyone, by making it avaiable online for free, and also by offering vouchers for free access to his Udemy course in which he runs through each chapter in his highly praised book.</p>

<p>I have gone through the first four sections, which largely take you through the basics of programming with Python, getting you to grips with variables, functions and error handling. It also takes you through flow control, which is the order in which Python runs through a program or function. This, unlike the other sections isnâ€™t something Iâ€™d run through before and I found it very useful to understand.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be continuing with the book, likely along with the online course, as it is set out for any level of programmer and feels almost like a fomral beginners course for programming, from which Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™d benefit. Whilst maybe not directly related to some things Iâ€™ll be doing in terms of data analysis, with Python, some of the automations I feel may come in handy.</p>

<p>The Udemy course becomes free every so often. I stumbled across a post by Al on Reddit where he was sharing coupons to get it for free or for however much you wanted to pay. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/automate/">The course on Udemy can be found here.</a></p>
