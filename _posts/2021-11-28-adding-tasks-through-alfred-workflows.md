One of my favourite apps for productivity on the Mac is [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). It's a suped up version of Spotlight or for the windows comparison it's like the Windows search function. I use Alfred around close to 100 times a day to launch apps, search for files, do Google searches, grab items off the clipboard history and more.

Another one of my favourite tools is [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Notion is an all-in-one Notetaking workspace. I use it to capture my learning, track projects, jot down notes and a thousand other things.

To keep track of tasks at work and prioritise accordingly, I'm currently trialling the '[Getting things done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)' framework. A key feature to the GTD approach is that you offload tasks from your mind into an 'Inbox' which can be sorted later. It's important to do this while you remember the tasks, which is often not very long.

Notion is the tool I use to capture the tasks, however, speed can be an issue with Notion. Opening Notion and navigating to the right area can take a little time and a few clicks. This is where Notion and its amazing workflows comes in. Workflows are only available if you pay for a 'Powerpack' but it opens up an amazing amount of customisation.
