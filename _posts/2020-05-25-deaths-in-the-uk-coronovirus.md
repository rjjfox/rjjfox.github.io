<!--description-->

The graph shows the downward trend in the number of deaths recorded and hopefully that we are over the peak.

This graph was created using the [Matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) module. It's a 'MATLAB-like plotting framework', MATLAB being a popular software/environment/language used by many over the past 30 years.
